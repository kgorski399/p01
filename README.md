This project is a serverless application that simulates an animal farm where the number of animals increases or decreases based on the overall satisfaction of the farm. User interactions, such as feeding and watering the animals, impact the farm's satisfaction level. The application leverages AWS services like Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Step Functions for automation and scaling.
